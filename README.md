# umMDR
A unified model based MDR framework for detecting gene-gene interaction


## Description
 A two-step unified model based MDR approach (UM-MDR), in which, the significance of a multi-locus model, even a high-order model, can be easily obtained through a regression framework, and a semiparametric correction procedure is designed to control type I error rates


## Installation
* Download the package umMAD_0.1.tar.gz from this respository
* To install, in R: 
 ```
 install.packages("path/umMDR_0.1.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
 ```
 
## Usage 
 ```
 umMDR(snp.all, phe, K = 2, cova = NULL, classm = "mean",
 adj.main = "FALSE", nperm = 5)
 ```
 
## Example 
 ```
 library(umMDR)
 snps <- matrix(rbinom(100 * 5, 1, 0.2), nrow = 100)  ## generate 5 snps
 phe <- rnorm(100)  ## generate phenotype
 umMDR(snps, phe, 2)
 ```
